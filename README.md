# HW2
## Devlog

1.[https://github.com/UCI-GDIM32-W25/mg2-Jpinson07/commit/f38cd766ecbad254c55c90e9910681eb86951d26]
In this commit I started to create the basis of the world that I am going to be working on by adding the player the coin and the ground. Doing this I now have the foundation of the world I am going to start coding afterwards. 

2. The plan I wrote for the MG2 breakdown connects to the code I wrote because in the breakdown I knew I need to code the player to jump so I had to call the method jump and define it. But I also knew I need to update the UI so I called the method updateUI so when the player interacts and collects a coin the points increases by an increment of one. I also knew that the scene was endless so I had to create a method to make the screen scroll so I devised a method to have the scene endlessly scroll. I also knew in my breakdown that the coins endlessly spawn so I had to create a method to spawn the coins endlessly.
